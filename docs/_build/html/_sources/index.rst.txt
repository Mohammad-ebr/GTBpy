GTBpy Documentation
====================

**GTBpy** is a toolbox that implements bubble tests from the following papers:

- **PWY (SADF test)**: Phillips, Wu, and Yu (2011)  
- **PSY (GSADF test)**: Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015)  
- **WHL test**: Whitehouse, Harvey, and Leybourne (2022)  

The package also includes two tests for evaluating forecast performance:

- **Equal MAFE and MSFE test**: Harvey, Leybourne, and Newbold (1997)  
- **Forecast encompassing test**: Harvey, Leybourne, and Newbold (1998)

Additionally, GTBpy introduces a novel method for constructing a search index using **Google Trends** data.
